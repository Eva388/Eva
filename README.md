This is the repository for the first year Bachelor project of the Bachelor Astronomy and Physics.

The team members for this Project are:

In this project we are looking at the effect of surfactant charge on the lubrication dynamics. For this we are plotting the friction coefficient against different
rotation speeds. This gives us stribeck curves which allows us to analyze changes in lubrication dynamics. 

The tribometer folder contains the files related to the analysis and the data used for analysis. The saved plots folder contains the results of the analysis plotted 
as Stribeck curves. Finally, the droplet angle measurement folder contains data related to an extra exploratory analysis conducted to explore possible causes for 
unexpected results.
